# Run-FS-UAE-from-SDCard

These scripts were made by me to make it more hassle free to mount and run FS-UAE from a connected SD card.

Currently it only works on Mac OS X and have only been tested on three different models of Macintosh computers.

Linux support is in progress. Feel free to fork and send pull request of edits!
